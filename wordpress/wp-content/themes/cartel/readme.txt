== Description ==
Cartel is a thoroughly modern and minimalist responsive theme designed to showcase your written content and featured images. The homepage showcases a single featured post, either your latest or a sticky post, followed by a masonry grid of all the latest. The home page also has a dedicated widget area so you can add some highlighted content or call to action there (see the demo for example). For single posts and pages, you have the option of choosing a simple centered layout or the traditional layout with a right-hand sidebar.

* nested comments can only take 2 levels deep
